    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that is typically made with layers of flat pasta sheets, tomato-based sauce, cheese, and various other ingredients such as meat, vegetables, and herbs. The dish is named after the pasta sheets themselves, which are known as "lasagne" in Italian.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 cans (6 ounces each) tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until the meat is browned and the onion is tender. Drain off any excess fat.</li>
      <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, basil, salt, pepper, and parsley to the skillet. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package directions. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
      <li>In a small bowl, beat the egg. Add the ricotta cheese and Parmesan cheese and mix well.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread about 1 cup of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 3 lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread about 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle with 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers two more times.</li>
      <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
      <li>Let the lasagna stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
